  <h1 class="mb-4">About SwipeScript</h1>

  <h2 class="mt-4">About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm [Your Name], a software developer passionate about creating engaging web applications.
    I love solving complex problems and learning new technologies. My approach to development focuses on
    writing clean, maintainable code while delivering intuitive user experiences.
  </p>

  <h2 class="mt-4">Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    SwipeScript is a full-stack demonstration project that playfully presents itself as a dating platform for dogs.
    While the concept is fun, the technical implementation is serious - showcasing modern web development
    practices and enterprise-level architecture. This portfolio piece demonstrates my ability to build
    secure, scalable, and user-friendly applications.
